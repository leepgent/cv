\opening{Dear Rock*,}

I would like to be considered for the position of Rage Generalist Programmer as advertised on the Rockstar website.

I am a qualified, talented and experienced C++ software engineer and avid gamer; computer games and programming have been my life since the Sinclair Spectrum.  I am particularly interested in Rockstar because of the affinity I feel for Rockstar games (I have been a GTA fan since the DMA Design days) and the pioneering technologies employed in the games.

My love of games and gaming extends beyond their entertainment value: I am also very much interested in the culture of gaming, the use of games as a storytelling medium and I firmly believe games are every bit as important as cinema and literature.  I have founded and managed several long-running gaming societies, FPS clans and MMORPG guilds.  Finally, I have considerable experience with many gaming platforms - primarily Windows, Xbox 360 and the Nintendo DS.

I have previously been employed in several small high-tech start-ups where I developed not only broad programming and IT skills in addition to excellent C++ and OO design experience, but an agility that was critical to our business's success as well as keen problem-solving skills.  I have extensive practical experience of building GUIs, server-side systems, RPC mechanisms and middleware - please see my resum\'{e} for more details.  I am also an advocate of open-source software and regularly use OSS libraries in both commercial and personal projects - I am principally interested in client-server, SOA and network technologies (especially SOAP \& Web Services).

I believe I can enrich Rockstar with my relevant engineering skills, good humour and interpersonal skills, thirst for experience, desire for excellence and love of gaming.  I have no doubt that I could add value to a team responsible for building and growing top-quality, market-leading software frameworks, platforms and APIs.

I would welcome the opportunity to be interviewed for this position and can be reached at any time via e-mail (lee@leegent.net), telephone (+447748183797) or Skype (lee.gent).

Many thanks for your time and consideration, I hope to hear from you soon.
